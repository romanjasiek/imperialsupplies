## Final Words

Since this is the last project I will do at the DCI, I would like to thank my teachers, especially Jamie, Ghassan and Leon, my classmates, all the smart people who share their knowledge on Youtube or Udemy (Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller, DevEd, Brad Traversy, Jannis Seemann, Ryan Dhungel), at Stack Overflow and all the other valuable resources for aspiring developers. And last but not least the DCI itself for giving people the opportunity to start a whole new career path even when they are almost 40.

THANK YOU ðŸ™Œ

My one year of full-time remote study in the MERN stack is over now, but my journey as a developer has just begun. ðŸš€
